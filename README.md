Udacity Movie Trailer Website
-----------------------------
This is the first Udacity project for the fullstack nano-degree which
 demonstrates the use of python **classes**.

entertainment_center.py produces a website with movie posters & their trailers.

While following along with lectures, I wrote these files:

- entertainment_center.py
- media.py

These files were provided:

- media.py
- fresh_tomatoes.py
