Udacity Movie Trailer Website
-----------------------------
This is the first Udacity project for the fullstack nano-degree which
 demonstrates the use of python *classes*. The **entertainment_center.py** file produces a website with movie posters and their trailers.

While following along with lectures, I wrote these files:

- entertainment_center.py
- media.py

These files were provided:

- media.py
- fresh_tomatoes.py
